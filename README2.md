For this assignment I started with a few assumptions:  The working directory has already 
been set; the data has been downloaded and unzipped and is ready to be read.  

I did not include the lines of code to set the working directory nor to unzip the data 
files in any of my programs.

For questions #4-6 of this assignment, I did thought the best way to answer the questions 
were to try and separate and identify some interesting categories of sources of emissions
for coal and motor vehicles respectively, as opposed to just looking at a total count.
